Hey, I’m a still / early-stage developer & programmer.  
I’m learning, experimenting, and building stuff as I go.

Nothing here is perfect (yet), but I’m improving every day.  
Expect messy code, random ideas, and progress over time.

Want to work with me? Dm me on the platforms or my email and maybe we will do something together (not promising anything)
 
Email is on my website same as socials.
